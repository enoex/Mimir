# Odysseus
HTML powered writing app using ReactJS, Reflux, Webpack

# Installation
1. `npm install -d`
2. `npm run local`

# Usage
To have webpack watch and compile files as changes are made, run `npm run local`. This will compile the files, but you will need to serve them.

To serve files, you can run `npm run dev`, which will launch the webpack dev server on port `7000`. Alternatively, you can server them outside of webpack with something like [http-server](https://www.npmjs.com/package/http-server)
